# The rs713586 risk variant dysregulates ADCY3 rather than DNAJC27, leading toobesity through ZFP42-TET1-mediated DNA methylation

## Background
Human genetic analyses have identified numerous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in noncoding regions associated with obesity-related traits; however, the functional contributions of such SNP loci to obesity are largely unknown. The noncoding variant rs713586, with its risk allele C, is linked to two candidate genes, DNAJC27 and ADCY3, potentially implicated in obesity. However, whether rs713586 primary targets ADCY3 or DNAJC27 gene to regulate body weight and what molecular mechanisms underlie this process, remain unclear.
